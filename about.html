        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div data-testid="test-about-bio">
        <p>My name is Joshua Kolawole. I grew up curious about how things work, which led me to study Physics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, and later to a hands on path in frontend development and QA. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while fixing phones and helping with sound at events, and those practical problems sharpened my attention to detail and my appetite for clean, usable interfaces. Along the way I served as President of Gacsfel OOU, led music and media teams, and learned to blend technical discipline with creative thinking.</p>
        <p>Today I build accessible, user focused web experiences while practicing testing and quality assurance, and I still play drums, keyboard and guitar to keep my creativity active. My story is about combining analytical training with artistic practice, learning by doing, and using leadership opportunities to grow others as I grow; I aim to keep shipping useful projects, improving my testing and frontend skills, and mentoring others in the community.</p>

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <div data-testid="test-about-future-note">
        <p>Remember why you started this path: to build useful, beautiful tools that help people. Keep curiosity as your engine, and discipline as your daily practice. When a task feels hard, break it down, learn one small thing, then ship it. Celebrate progress, not perfection, and keep balancing technical growth with creative rest.</p>
        <p>Track your work with short notes, update your portfolio after each meaningful project, and mentor one person every few months to solidify what you learn.</p>

        <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
        <div data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <p>Technology moves fast, and community moves faster. I believe in sharing knowledge, helping others get unstuck, and making accessible software a baseline expectation. Long term, I want to build products that respect users, perform reliably, and scale responsibly. For now, I will focus on steady, measurable improvements and clear, documented work.</p>
